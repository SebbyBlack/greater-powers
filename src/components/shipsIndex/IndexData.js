        text: {chp1:`Before the Astral Realm:`, c1v1:  `

        In the beginning, there was the Maelstrom. And from the blinding light that emanates from the top of the fountain of Astral Power is the Divine Illumination. And orbiting the great fountain of power are the heavenly realms. And their orbits steadily occluding and releasing the light of the illumination throughout the realms gives rise to the diurnal cycles of day and night that marks the passage of time throughout the planes. 
        But before the cycle of day and night began the unrelenting energy from the eye of the storm brought forth monstrous and powerful beings known as the Titans. These were creatures of unparalleled elemental power. The cosmic forces of Order and Chaos, Light and Darkness manifested themselves into these beings of cosmic might. 
        Over the course of unknowable eons, the titans created endless arrays of beats and monsters, and formed the formless energies of the void into matter and energy. Or so the stories say.`, 
        
        chp2: `First Gods Rise`,
        c2v1:
        `However, over time the titans grew cruel and merciless. They delighted in tormenting and ruling over the inhabitants of the realms with a capricious and terrifying glee. And thus the creatures of the realms began to pray. Pray and hope for salvation. And from the eldritch energies of their thoughts and hopes arose the first Gods.`,
        c2v2: 
        `Imbued with the hopes and prayers of countless mortal souls from across every realm the New gods did battle with the titans. Across land and sky the titanic struggles shook the whole of the Astral. And so they fought a desperate and pitched war for control of the cosmos.`, 
        c2v3:
        `And as all know, in the end a final alliance of the mightiest of gods were able to unseat the titans from their places of power and threw them down the eye of the maelstrom. Imprisoning the ancient titans for all time. 
        And the place wherein the Titans were imprisoned was the land of eternal night. The realm Tartarus.`, 
        
        chp3:`Tartarus - Titans Prison`,
        c3v1:
        `Tartarus is a realm of eternal darkness. It lies at the very base of the cosmic maelstrom below the deepest layers of the Abyss. It is a realm of the darkest horrors inhabited by the most monstrous creations of the ancient titans and the titans themselves.`, 

        chp4:
        `Dragon Queen Tiamat & Dragon Creation`,
        c4v1:
        `And the task of guarding the ancient behemoths of creation was given to the Elder Goddess Tiamat. And to assist her in her eternal task of guarding the gates of Tartarus she created the race of dragons. Formed from the energies of the maelstrom itself, dragons are innately magical beasts with incredible power and formidable ferocity. And the goddess Tiamat tied the lives of dragons to the chains that bound the titans to the pits of Tarturus. For the more fiercely the titans struggled to escape their chains, the more dragons would be born into the realms. And the ages where the titans were quiescent, fewer dragons would be born. Thus ensuring that the great guardians of the pit would always have the strength in numbers to counter the power of the ancient titans.`, 
        c4v2:
        `Tiamat is a dragon type Titan. Taking the form of a massive wingless multi-headed Hydra, the Queen of dragonkind she rules over her brood from her lair deep in Tartarus. With each of her heads representing a dragon of one of the elemental types. (Order, Chaos, Light, and Darkness) However currently Tiamat only possesses three heads. Each taking the form of the dragon of that element. Ancients legends claim that Tiamat once had four heads, but the head of light escaped and was reborn as Bahamut, the Father of Phoenixes.`,
        c4v3: 
        `The mighty mistress of malevolent dragons possesses a breath weapon of the same type the dragon of that Arcana would also possess. The clockwork head is a simulacrum and does not possess the same degree of power as an actual clockwork dragon.`, 
        c4v4:
        `The hero Achilles destroyed the head of Order long ago and the dragon queen replaced it with simulacra golem. However, the chaos and undead heads lack for nothing in their potency.`, 
        c4v5:
        `The dragon queen lays eggs which are then taken by chosen adult dragons to be hatched and protected until they come of age. This makes Tartarus a massive dragon hive. The might of the great dragon legions easily parallels the strength of the greatest of gods. Only the undying oath of the dragon queen to guard Tartarus keeps dragons from overtaking and conquering the realms. 
        And so it has been for ages beyond counting. The mightiest and eldest of dragonkind guarding the Tartarus gate along with their great queen Tiamat, protecting the realms from the absolute destruction that would ensue if the titans were ever to be released from their eternal prisons.`, 
        
        chp5: `Tiamat/Dragon Current affairs`,
        c5v1:
        `But times may be changing. It is rumored the Tartarus gate is open. Whispers spread across the realms that Tiamat has left her post and now strides across the maelstrom. 
        Dragons now fly the skies in the Abyss with greater and greater frequency. Even the realms of Midgard and the gates of heaven have been accosted by Dragon squadrons. And more disturbing rumors still exist that many of the missing greater powers now lie chained alongside the titans in the depths of Tartarus.`, 
        
        chp6:`Shiva`,
        c6v1: 
        `Despite these rumors, the Celestial emperor Shiva refuses to send agents to the pit to ascertain the truth of it. And none in the Celestial Administratum can understand why they can not be allowed to know the truth.`, 
        c6v2:
        `Events have reached a head and the Lords General of the Order of Leo and the Triumvirs of the Legio Asura have scheduled a greater conclave. It is said they plan to defy the mandate of the emperor and will seek to form a great host to breach the Abyss and enter Tartarus itself. For the fates of all depend on knowing the truth.`,
        c6v3: 
        `But what shall happen to the realms when the Hosts of Heaven and the Hordes of the Abyss meet on the battlefield again? It is a terrible question, the answer to which not even the greatest scholars of the Ivory Tower can prognosticate.

        chp1:`Astral Realm History`, 
        c1v1:
        `There are many worlds. Beyond the veil that limits mortals to a universe of only three dimensions, ancient and mighty beings rule over and influence the worlds of the many universes.
        The realm in which the gods reside has been known by many names. Heaven, Hell, the afterlife, the underworld; all these are just legends based on the glimpses of the truth mortals can discern.`,
        c1v2:
        `For those who live alongside the Great Powers, this realm is known simply as The Astral. It is a realm of magic and belief. The physical laws of the many material universes apply but weakly in The Astral.
        Scholars at the Ivory Tower have concluded that this was because objects in The Astral are not composed of physical matter as it is in the mortal realms. They are instead composed of the energy of will and belief. This leads to a universe of vast variety and bewildering complexity.
        Travelers on the Astral will often find that environments change and in an unpredictable fashion. And to add to this difficulty in navigation, areas in which people can survive are literally islands floating in a vast tractless sea of clouds. Each island shaped by the character of its rulers and denizens.
        There is however, one constant.`, 
        c1v3:
        `Power in The Astral is based on and totally relies on the energy of belief or faith of mortals who reside in one of the many physical universes. Through a process known only to the Gods, this belief is channeled through a mystical Soul Relic and grants abilities and Power to the gods.
        In ancient times the secret to this was jealously guarded by the Pantheons of the Greater Powers. These ancient gods accumulated unimaginable power and ruled with absolute impunity. As is obvious to all, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The old Gods are no exception to that rule.`,
        c1v4:
        `Over time almost every Pantheon became increasingly erratic and sometimes malevolent. Soon they began warring with each other. The War in Heaven, like all wars was over resources.
        Specifically the souls and belief of mortals in the physical planes. For reasons unknown, when a mortal dies, their immortal soul passes through the veil and enters the Astral. Usually those souls are drawn to the realm of the God they worship.`,
        c1v5:
        `In order to gain more souls and increase their power, The Greater Powers developed Avatar magics. 
        Using these abilities, a Power is able to create a mortal shell on a mortal realm and temporarily transfer their consciousness and a small measure of their magical abilities to that mortal shell. But since the Greater Powers are individuals and cannot be everywhere at once, they grant this ability as a boon to their greatest champions. 
        And these heroes stride across the realms of gods and men bringing the word and might of their patron with them.
        After the end of the War in Heaven, most of the ancient gods were dead or dying and their realms shattered husks of their former glory. This was the beginning of the modern age. We stand today, ten thousand cycles after the end of the Age of Gods. In the current age, the Greater Powers no longer war openly in the Astral. They instead battle each other by proxy in the realms of mortals. Each sending their heroes to the realms of men to increase their influence and decrease the power of their rivals. This however is not why the current age is no longer the age of gods. The Age of Gods ended because of the actions of one man.`,
        c1v6:
        `During the waning days of the war in heaven, the entirety of the cosmos also lay in ruins. An endless array of worlds across the cosmos were devastated by the wars of faith caused by feuding Deities. The untold suffering of mortals formed a region in The Astral called the Chaos Storm. And from this storm spewed forth horrors untold. Demons, monsters, a whole cornucopia of demented terrors from the Chaos Storm moved about, destroying whatever was not already in ruins.`,
        c1v7:
        `Into this dying cosmos came one man. Nobody knows what his name was, but there are none alive who do not know who he is now. Even in the realms of mortal men, his tale is told. Granted, these tales are all highly inaccurate and are colored by the agendas of the Greater Powers, but they essentially tell the same story. The story of the Light Bringer.`,
        c1v8:
        `Known by many names, the great Promethean, is the current Archmagus of the Ivory Tower. According to the ancient myths, the Archmagus was once the greatest champion of one of the Ancient Gods. But over time his dedication to his patron wavered. The most popular tale was that the Light Bringer lost faith in his Patron after he flooded an entire world and nearly annihilated its population just to reduce the power of a rival god. For forty days and forty nights the old God made it rain on that unfortunate mortal world, drawing water from other physical worlds and channeling it from one world into another.`,
        c1v9:
        `The suffering and loss of life led to an expansion of the maelstrom so great that whole armies of demons besieged even the cities of the Powerful Pantheons. This is a concern because as everyone knows, when a soul is killed by a demon in The Astral, its energy dissipates and can never be reborn as a mortal. The immortal soul dies.`,
        c1v10:
        `After the atrocity by the unknown God. The Promethean enacted a plan that continues to this day. First, he stole the secret of Soul Relics. Nobody knows how he managed it, but the eternally guarded secret of how to harness the power of souls was now in his hands. Using this newly acquired knowledge, he began to amass an army to challenge the rule of the old gods. 
        It is said nearly a third of the heavens turned on their previous masters and followed the titan to end the calamitous rule of faith.
        The strategy he employed was nothing short of brilliant. Unlike the gods before him, the Archmagus did not hoard the secret of power. Instead, he spread the secret of power to everyone he found. Soon, souls from every corner of the Astral were forming Pantheons of their own and sending heroes and avatars to the realms of men.`, 
        c1v11:
        `Alongside this planned chaos, he formed the Collegia Scholarium, called by some students the University, and to most others as the Ivory Tower.
        The Ivory Tower is the greatest weapon in the cosmos against the abuses of gods. It stands as a shining beacon of hope to the oppressed souls of mortals across the many universes. Agents of the Tower are charged with the acquisition, preservation, and dissemination of knowledge and science. 
        For there is no greater danger to the power of faith, than knowledge. The tower sends wizards to the mortal realms to foster science and bring the secrets of civilization to the worlds of men. 
        Because the success and brilliance of his plan, the cosmos has remained in a fairly stable state for ten thousand cycles. All due to the revolution and leadership of the Lightbringer. He quite literally brought the light of fire to all the peoples of the cosmos.`,
        c1v12:
        `Through the rise of science in the mortal realms and competition between new powers and the old Gods in the Astral realm, no one god has been able to attain enough power to devastate the cosmos as occurred during the War in Heaven. 
        This check on their power was not taken to lightly by the old gods. And just as is the case today, gods always do everything in their power to curtail the spread of knowledge and encourage distrust of science. 
        Their opposition to the existence of the Collegia is so strong that they even spread the belief across the physical plane that science is evil or dangerous. They use the old language title of the Archmagus to mean the ultimate evil or devil. Luciphoros, meaning the light of the flame, is the official old language title of the Archmagus. 
        He is the champion of mortal men and the defender of the realms against the corruption of unchecked power. We, the mages and scholars of the tower proudly carry the torch of knowledge to every corner of the cosmos.
        In this series of writings, I will expand upon and explain many details and facts learned and acquired by the Ivory Tower over the last ten thousand cycles.

        text:{chp1:`The Alignment Cold War`, c1v1:`After the end of the War in Heaven, the remaining Pantheons agreed to a type of armistice. Those Pantheons broke apart and reformed into the four Arcana. The Lesser Arcana of Light, and Darkness, and the Greater Arcana Order, and Chaos. 
        The Arcana are for better or worse the new rulers of the universe. All souls, even itinerant Powers, are under the jurisdiction of one or more of the Arcana. Any soul, be they god or mortal are allowed to join one of the many Pantheons. The Pantheons themselves are allowed to align themselves with two Arcana (One greater, one lesser).`, c1v2:`The representatives of Arcana often are the ones who give requests, missions, demands, etc etc to the Pantheons which are aligned to that arcana. 
        As a further check against a second occurrence of a cosmos wide war, no pantheon outside of the Arcana can be aligned with only one Arcana. This of course refers to bands of gods and souls outside the tower. `,  c1v3: `As ivory tower wizards, agents of the collegia are prohibited from joining a pantheon or allying themselves with any of the Arcana. Instead, the Ivory Tower maintains the balance and stability of the cosmos. Sometimes doing this by removing a god from existence who threatens the balance. But usually it is through the spreading of knowledge and the manufacture of power Gems and soul relics. 
        By ensuring a healthy supply of these in circulation, no one god can ever rise to the type of supreme power which enabled the dark power JHVH to commit genocide by flood on the realm of earth. 
        The rivalry between scientists from the tower and the followers of the Arcana are known to be among the most active in the cosmos. The Arcana seek to establish the dominance of faith and belief across the cosmos in order to bolster their powers. `, c1v4: `While agents trained at the Ivory Tower seek to spread knowledge and science through the cosmos. This often places the two great organizations at odds. In recent centuries the Ivory Tower has achieved a minor victory as common folk across the Astral stoped referring to the old gods and users of soul relics as Gods. Instead, they are known simply as the Powers. 
        And among the powers they ranks themselves greater lesser and minor. Young powers seek to become lesser powers. And lesser powers seek to gain enough followers and influence to become a greater power. `, c1v5: `Each of the four Arcana is governed by a pantheon that consists only of greater powers. Over the millennia, the membership of those Pantheons has shifted and changed. Some powers falling from light to darkness. Going mad and moving from order to chaos. And occasionally some the other way... Few of the old gods remain, and fewer still stand with light and order. Most have long since fallen to darkness and chaos.

        Of these Midgard is the Largest, and the underworld and high heavens are a fraction of the size. Each rectangular area in the image above represents a zone where there is breathable atmosphere and open space. Inside these zones is where skyship travel is possible to any of the thousands of floating islands. `, c1v2:`The orbits of the three heavenly cities obscure the light from the eye of the maelstrom creating day and night cycles in Midgard. The Abyss is too far from the illumination and blocked by large cloud wall layers and therefore is perpetually dim and dark.
        The shaded areas on the outside represent impassable cloudwalls. This is where the cloudsea becomes to dense to allow travel.`, c1v3:`Skyships cannot fly outside of the floatplanes. However, all three of the Astral planes are linked at their centers by the great Maelstrom. The Maelstrom runs from the bottom to the top, funneling energy from the Astral realm and spewing it out the top casting the divine illumination. The Maelstrom is inhabited by Gemini Pirates, the only ones who know the secrets of crossing the Great storm without destroying their ships.`,c1v4:`Travel between different realms by Skyship is almost impossible, as one must wait for rare cloud cover clearings to navigate through the cloud walls to get from one to the next without the use of portals. Thankfully, the Ivory Tower magi have created multiple portal systems that allow travelers to bypass the cloud walls. 
        The soul vortex at the bottom represents how the souls of the dead from the mortal realms enter the Astral realm. The soul vortex opens at the soul gates in the city of Atlantis in the Abyss. From Atlantis, most souls travel to Midgard on board The Express. The capital of the Abyss, Enoch, is always at war with Atlantis trying to seize control of the soul gates. `, 
        
        chp2:`Metaphysics of the Astral Plane - Physical Properties`, 
        c2v1:`The astral plane is the nexus between physical reality and the beliefs of mortals 
        Most of the Astral plane consists of vast cloud seas called Heliospheres. 
        A heliosphere is roughly a disc shaped vortex centered around the crystal sun. 
        Orbiting the crystal sun are agglomerations of crystal islands bound by gravity to the various Astral Realms. 
        Regular matter in the astral realms manifests as the astral cloud sea in the astral plane. `, c2v2:`Regular matter brought into the astral plane generates a short range Astral cloud that generates kinetic repulsion against other cloud matter. This causes regular matter to float on top of the cloud seas. `, c2v3:`Gravity causes regular matter to aggregate into large floating islands. These islands are the realms of the players. 
        To bring matter into the astral plane requires souls. For every soul of a believer that crosses into the astral after death, brings along a tiny bit of normal matter/energy. This matter is usually added to the realm of that mortal soul's god. `, c2v4:` Souls are then bound to the realms of their chosen deity. 
        Souls bound to a player's realm power that power's abilities. 
        Players send the souls of their heroes through the crystalline veil into one of the realms by using the power of the converted souls in their realm.

        chp1a: `i - Sky Kraken attacking Unaligned Merchant`, 
        c1v1:`The realms of The Astral float on great cloud seas. These clouds are not formed of water but instead are formed of the energy that physical objects project through the veil which separates the Astral from the mortal realms. 
        This causes that matter to diffuse and disperse into clouds which repel ordinary matter. This repulsion field generated by the clouds of the Astral Sea is what allows the mighty skyships to travel to every corner of The Astral. Certain scholars in the Ivory Tower theorize that the kinetic energy impacts of cloud particles against each other in the Astral Sea don’t result in an exact 1:1 action:reaction ratio. `, c1v2:` This means that some of the resulting acceleration is occurring along non-Astral vectors. So if two particles impact in the Astral Sea and move apart, that bet energy difference is likely experienced by that object in the physical plane as acceleration towards the contacts particle in their three dimensional space. 
        This means that gravity is created in the Astral Sea. Quite literally, the realm of spirit is what gives rise to the realm of matter.`,

        c2v1:`(Reference image - click link for more)
        The Astral Realms are an endless expanse of levitating islands, suspended in a trackless sea of clouds. Storms, doldrums, and even vast vortexes appear randomly and without warning. Entire fleets of ships vanish without a trace. And through this treacherous expanse, sailors and cloudscouts risk life and limb to explore just one more island. To see what lies beyond the next bank of clouds.
        Players will be able to explore these endless oceans of sky and find high adventure.`, c2v2:` How things work in the Astral Realms 
        The Astral Realm is an entirely separate pocket universe linked to our own physical universe. However it exists alongside within its own 3 dimensional vector space or Hamel Space. 
        Most of the Astral Realm consists of diffuse inversely expanding spacetime. This strange phenomena causes the spacetime to manifest or materialize as cloudlike formations instead of as normal hard matter as it does in our universe. `, c2v3:`The inverse expansion of spacetime within the Cloud Seas of the Astral Realm cause the clouds to generate a small diffuse antigravitational effect, this effect can then be localized and concentrated through the use of magically infused Levitation Crystals. (Commonly referred to by the locals as “Floatstones”). 
        Most of the sentient Population in the Astral Realms can be classified as either: `,
        c2v4: `Mortal Souls: These refer to the bulk of the people in the Astral Realm. When mortals die in the physical universe, part of their cohesive identity or their “soul” is able to traverse between the wall that separates the Astral and Physical planes. If that soul crosses into the Astral Realm it coalesces or manifests itself as a physical entity. The form of the body the soul takes is related to both the self image of the soul in question and it’s association with any power already residing in the Astral.`, c2v5:`The remainder are what are called: 
        Athropomorphic manifestations, or Physiomorphic manifestations. In a universe where power is quite literally tied to belief, the beliefs held by the many souls in the Astral as well as the beliefs of mortals still in the physical universe coalesce and take form. Any archetypal Power, ability, event, mythical belief, etc... can and probably has at some point manifested itself as a sentient entity somewhere in the realms. These types of beings are usually the ones who manage to elevate themselves to the rank of Powers. 
        Where do the floating islands come from? How is there matter from the physical universe in the Astral? `, c2v6:`There are many mythical stories regarding these questions, but scholars at the Ivory Tower have conducted many tests and have determined that when a soul crosses the veil, the transference isn’t 100% efficient. In other words, the soul doesn’t come as pure energy. It usually drags along some matter with it, a few atoms here and there. Usually these atoms become detached and float around aimlessly in the vast cloud seas, but over billions of years, enough has collected together to create the endless array of floating islands that dot the Astral Seas. `,
        chp3:`How does a giant island float?`,
        c3v1:`Most islands are infused with vast veins of Floatstones. 
        While floatstones react in an antigravitational way to the Astral Clouds, they interact with normal matter the same way any other matter does. It is gravitationally attracted to it.
         Over time gravity has drawn together huge clumps of normal matter and maelstrom enhanced matter. As time progressed the islands not only got larger, but attracted various flora and fauna. `, c3v2:`As all life in the Astral Realm is magical in one way or another, they create a magical field that infused the floatstones with power and causes the whole thing to stabilize and generate powerful lift. 
         How does normal matter become a floatstone? 
         While the exact processes are still a mystery, one thing is known for certain. Long periods of exposure to the energy of the maelstrom often infused matter with strange effects.
         It causes rocks to float and oftentimes creatures will mutate or gain eldritch abilities. `,
         chp4:`What is the maelstrom?`, 
         c4v1:`The maelstrom is a huge neverending circular storm that fills the center of the known Astral Realm. 
         It exists as sort of a reverse cyclone, which instead of drawing objects in towards it, is constantly streaming out magical and physical energy.
         The elder gods still refer to the Maelstrom as the “Wellspring” and it is commonly believed that all magic in the Astral owes its existence to the Maelstrom. 
         Can you die in the Astral Realm?
         Technically no, but receiving enough damage to your physical form can cause you to lose physical cohesion and your soul will disperse. `,
         c4v2:` Without the physical structure to maintain your identity, many souls disperse and are never able to coalesce again. 
         How do sailing ships that only move as fast as the wing able to cross distances that must surely be thousands of miles or more in such short periods? 
         This is because in a region of inversely expanding spacetime, time does not pass in a strictly linear fashion. 
         And because the only real physical processes occurring in the Astral, which happens over millions of years, there is no physical marker or process that time can be objectively measured against. 
         This allows vast linear distances to be crossed without a firmly attached temporal comparison point. While this usually is beneficial as it allows for easy and convenient sailing across the seas, 
         cloud storms and other meteoromagical events can reverse the effect as well, making someone who only traveled a few yards suddenly experience the passage of many years instead. 
         Most skyships and populated islands have magical wards and shields in place to prevent this though. `,
         chp5:`How does a lesser Power become a greater power?`, 
         c5v1:`It’s simple. Just get more people to believe and have faith in you. 
         As belief is tied to identity, and identity is the key magic type that grants structure to your physiomorphic projection, added faith from more sources adds more Oomph to your juice. 
         Why do heroes not keep their levels and equipment after a mission ends? `,
         c5v2:`While it is possible to send energy and matter back to the mortal realms using magical power and faith based energy. It is altogether almost impossible to bring back any significant quantity of real matter from the mortal realms to the Astral.
         This is why heroes can be equipped before a mission, but the magical energy required is significant, and the more magical an item is that you send with a hero, the more power it takes to push them through the veil. `,
         c5v3:`In fact, when the heroes return to the Astral, they often leave their physical body behind in the mortal realm as a corpse. A heroic corpse to be sure, but still a corpse. So they return with just their knowledge and glory. 
         If everything in the Astral is a manifestation of belief, aside from the rocks that make the islands, how can we affect them and how can they affect us? `,
         c5v4:`How, is really unknown, but the why is known. 
         It affects you because you believe it will. 
         Do all missions happen in the mortal realms? 
         No, most campaign missions take place in the Astral, while most dynamically generated missions happen in the mortal realm. 
         How do you generate enough magical power to make colossal ships float or propel them forward quickly? 
         Until a few hundred years ago, rapid acceleration of ships was simply impossible. But when the Sorcerer King Thor arrived he brought with him knowledge from his mortal plane. (Normally souls lose most their memory upon the crossing).`,
         c5v5:`But using this new knowledge, mages and scholars at the Ivory Tower developed the science of mechanomagics. 
         It was discovered that certain rotational physical motions done by magically infused materials creates a magical power field. 
         This is accomplished by creating large clockwork mechanisms that are wound and then when allowed to run, it spins various enchanted and magical materials in sequence creating a magical cascade field . `,
         c5v6:`Then using already commonly known channeling spells and enchanted items, that power is then channeled along certain paths and reconfigured as explosive rocket Force. Basically like casting a constant stream of fireballs out the back of the thruster module. 
         Why are floatstones always on the outside of ships? 
         This is because the levitation crystal must be in physical contact with the Astral cloud in order to initiate and maintain the antigravitational effect.`,
         chp6:`On the biosphere of the Astral Plane.`,
         c6v1:`The astral seas teem with soulfish
         Soulfish are what souls convert into after plants, animals, and unaligned sentient mortals die in the mortal realms. 
         Without the assistance of one of the Powers, the soul usually loses a great deal of cohesion upon crossing over from the physical realms. 
         This usually results in the soul becoming an amorphous blob of astral matter with only rudimentary awareness.
         These so called soulfish then swim endlessly across the astral seas until they get caught in a reincarnation vortex and pulled back into the mortal planes to be reborn.`,
         c6v2:`Souls belonging to followers of the Astral Powers are able to follow a soul conduit between the mortal realm and the Astral Realm of their chosen deity. The effectiveness of the conduit depends on the level of belief held by the soul of the recently deceased mortal.
         Upon exiting the conduit, most souls find themselves at the Soulgate. This is a large magical crystalline structure in the center of the realm of the Dark God Hades.`,
         c6v3:`From the soulgate, the spirits of the recently dead are given a choice of going to their deity’s realm, or wander the fields of Elysium for eternity.
         Hades, being the Lawful Neutral God of the Underworld, has set up a semi automated process of first categorizing souls based on their ethical content.
        Evil Souls are processed into a queu that takes those souls to the Frozen Abyss or the Burning Hells. Good Souls are allowed to stay in Elysium.
        Anytime before the determination, a power may enter the story of a mortal’s spirit and intercede on their behalf. Once Hades approves the intercession, a power can then take the soul of that mortal to their realm.
        The Greater Powers control docks near the Soulgate, but any power can attempt an intercession to be granted a hero.`

Gemini Pirates (Chaos) – Short Description

(Reference image - click link for more)
The ships of the Gemini Fleets are commanded by Elves and Humans from across every one of the realms. Their pursuit of freedom is legendary. Their mastery of the cloud seas unequalled. Sailors from the Gemini fleets can often be found carousing in port cities and despite their reputation as bloodthirsty marauders, the Pirates live by an inviolable code of respect. Those who also live by the code often find allies and the strongest of friendships amongst those who have mastered the Maelstrom.
The Gemini Fleets, making up the Archetypes of chaos, is a loose federation of unaligned islands and fleets of nomadic souls. The Gemini fleets consider themselves the only truly free peoples of the Astral. The Gemini Fleet make their home base within the great storm at the center of the Astral Realms The Maelstrom. Every ship and island aligned with Sorceress Queen Hecate possess a fragment of a magical relic called The Song of Chaos. This item generates a magical field which buffers any within it against the harmful effects of the Maelstrom. Through their intimate knowledge and life inside of the magical Maelstrom, Gemini Fleet members gain an innate understanding of the life cycles and ecosystem of the Astral Seas.
From the relatively safety of the Maelstrom, they are known to carry out raids against shipping convoys and colonies of the other greater Arcana (order). It is said the Dark Queen has built her fortress on the back of a massive Sky Kraken. Constant warring with Tower armies have forged Gemini Pirates into living Weapons. Those few who survive the constant Leo and Tower attacks often find themselves without a ship or a crew. Only their personal physical prowess and combat proficiency gave them a chance to live. Skill earned and hard fought by the most unforgiving of teachers... Experience. 
The Gemini Fleets are governed by (if you could call anything that happens there governing) the Princes of Chaos. These Princes are chosen through trials of combat held every ten years in Cloudwhale City. This is a legendary city built on the back of an ancient cloudwhale. Currently, all but four Princes have been assassinated and the remaining Princes hold the Dark Queen Prisoner in her own Kraken Barge. They seem to be trying to replace the Hecate with the Dragon Queen Tiamat (See Aries).  Yarr mateys, it’s a Pirate’s life for me.

History of the Gemini Pirates
They say, in the time before time; three sisters of fate wrought from the raw maelstrom of chaos, the wellspring of magic. From the wellspring came a torrent of magic into the realms in the form of a relic now known as the cosmic song. The ancient titans intended to create a mighty guardian of the wellspring brought to life by the cosmic song; however, the youngest of the sisters, Hecate, grew jealous of the authority of her other sisters and instead created a terrible weapon from the wellspring before the guardian could be finished. And from this fierce artifact she is able to bend the forces of chaos to her command.
For this unforgivable crime, Hecate was banished. Hecate knew this would be her fate, so in secret she took the mighty weapon with and fled the wellspring. With the weapon in her possession, she was never captured. And so Hecate grew old and eventually the weapon was passed to her heir, The Hecate. 
It’s debatable how true this myth is, but one thing is clear - the power of the relic. Each ship in the Gemini Pirate fleet possesses a piece of the song of chaos enchanted into a musical instrument. The Gemini Pirates live by a code, ‘those who can soothe the tides of chaos with their song can shape the face of reality’. Any who face the Gemini pirates in battle hear their magical/musical theme and tremble. 
Gemini Leader: Dark Elven Queen Lilith
The current leader of the Gemini Fleets is the Dark Elven Queen Lilith. Holder of the mantle of Hecate. And wielder of the song of chaos.
Queensreich - Hectate ship
The scourge of the Astral Seas, the unsinkable battle barge, the Queensreich. This immense Flying Fortress is the headquarters of the fractious Gemini Alliance and the home of the Pirate Queen Hecate herself.
Forged of incalculable amounts of hardened spellsteel and fireproofed ironwood. This imposing city sized dreadnought comes equipped with a pair of kraken pens which house two fully grown sky kraken.
On top of that lies a cacophony of improvised and stolen weaponry from all across the realms. Cannons and rocket launchers festoon the battlements and all manner of destructive implements lay everywhere to catch any unwary and destroy them.
This battleship is not merely a warship, but a full city. Full of shops and taverns. And wharfs with all manner of goods to trade. All built in the typical gemini style. And all this exists under the protection of the massive armor plates of the Queensreich 
And on top of it lies the Hephaestus forgeworks that churns out weapons and skyships for the alliance and all inside the immense battle barge.
Lest it’s awesome size and voluminous armor and armaments fool you, this behemoth can fly. 
She isn’t the most nimble of ships, but the massive banks of goblin engineered rockets that line and fill the drive compartments produce enough thrust for this flying mountain to catch even the fastest racer.
However if you anger the Pirate Queen enough for her to Activate the thrusters. Chances are good the thousands of pirate lords and captains at her command would have ended your life already.

Current Events - Gemini (as told by a pirate)
Many a rocklubber may think us nothing more than a collection of criminals and marauders, but life in the Gemini Fleets isn’t about the loot, it’s about freedom. Ok, maybe it’s also about the loot. What was I saying again? Oh yeah... Freedom. 
That’s what being a Sky pirate is all about. Give me a hold full of floatstones and Aldeberan Power Crystals, a clear night sky, and a tall ship to fly through it. That’s the life me’ hearties. 
The other Arcana might have cities and complicated governments, but that’s nothing to be proud of. A sky pirate would rather rot in prison than live a meaningless structured existence like those other mindless Arcana slaves. In the Gemini fleet, everyone knows what they got is worth having. Nothing is given to a sky pirate, they must take everything they have. By force if necessary. And even though we prefer to sail the cloud seas alone, it doesn’t hurt to know there is a squadron of buccaneer frigates nearby to form a flotilla the moment we catch wind of a tasty prize inching its way across the trackless Astral seas.
The Gemini Pirates are unique in that we have no city or centralized headquarters. Instead we all live on board our skyships, taking us wherever we feel like on any given day. And in the center of our domain lies the Maelstrom. The wellspring of all magic. The magical energies of the maelstrom is constantly converting normal matter like rocks and even wood into floatstones. The proximity to our terrain and the pirate lifestyle is perfect for this setup. The Gemini Pirates never have any shortage of good floatstone to keep our ships aloft. Which is good, since the rocklubbers have been venturing out less and less every year. 
The war those Aries flunkies have been pushing seems to be scaring most folks into staying home rather than venturing out into the Astral Planes. The interesting loot getting rarer and rarer as the cowards hide behind their stone walls. You’d think somebody would tell the Queen our way of life is being ruined by House Aries, then she could give the order and we go kill the bloody lubbers and get back to the sweet sweet days of looting... ahem, I mean freedom. But it takes weeks to sail back to the Royal Flotilla, and there’s nothing but goblins around once you get there. 
Goblins make good pirates, fair dinkum. But they are terrible neighbors. So I try and avoid the flag captains whenever possible. It’s safer that way. 
There’s rumors spreading that the commodores don’t even sail past the outside edge of the maelstrom anymore, which is very strange. How do they expect to command our respect if they don’t even have the guts to fly into the open cloudsea? 
Come to think of it, maybe it’s time we rousted that soggy old bunch in charge and got some fresh pirate lords calling the shots. Let’s keep that thought between you and me though, don’t want people getting the wrong idea about me being the mutinous kind against her ladyship. 
The pirate fleets are ruled by (if you could say we were ruled by anything) the Sorceress Hecate. There be tales that Hecate used to be another Hecate, but them’s just rumors, as long as I’ve been sailing the clouds, Hecate been Hecate. Probably easy to stay in charge forever when you’re a Dark elf like her. The Hecate seems to be the only Greater Power left that aint of Human or Angelic Stock. Heard she’s even worshipped by elves in the mortal worlds. The mortals call her Lilith. They worship her because her magic is so good. I guess her magic’s been good enough to keep us independent so far and she kept the skies free from dragons and space whales for a long time, until recently. 
Dragon attacks been increasing into a regularity and there’s been Aries ships spotted flying the Pink clouds near the maelstrom. Commodores orders say give the Aries a wide berth, but we are pirates. There’s no way we can pass up a good chance for loot and glory for too long... 
And this is where the player starts. They enter the fleet on its upswing. Contrary to the natural state of affairs, the fleet commanders have been issuing orders and making plans for what could be a major assault against one of the other Arcana. The council of free Goblins has tasked the Goblin Pirate Thrakkamor with obtaining a specific chest of goods from an Ivory Tower research convoy. 
Times are definitely changing, never thought I’d see the day pirate fleets would directly challenge the other Arcana ships when they are traveling in force. Especially a Tower research fleet. I don’t know what they are researching, but I think it is how to fit as many battleships and heavy cruisers into a small area as possible. It almost sounds like a suicide mission. 
It wouldn’t be worth the danger, if not for the loot we are being promised. 
Maybe we should go talk to Thrakka, couldn’t hurt to know at least a little more about what’s really going on with the Pirate council.

Gemini home base - Fleet & Cloudport Architecture 

(Reference image - click link for more)
Gemini Corsairs rarely live in cities and towns. However there are a few secret ports of call that are known to the Pirate captains and sailors. 
The islands holding these ports are usually hidden away and protected by cloud sea walls. Their architecture a mishmash of cultures and are rarely centrally planned. As such most structures are ramshackle assemblages of Ironwood and cast off ship parts. Long wooden suspension bridges and bright colors from merchants and traders frequent the lands Controlled by the gemini alliance.
Most Gemini cloudports are busy and bustling with people and activity.

Celestial Cove:(Gemini Cloudport/Town) 

They say a corsair’s skill and bravery alone is what creates a great pirate, but that pirate would soon be without a ship or crew without a friendly port of call. And with pirates being pirates, not many places are willing to do business with such dangerous customers. All except the Agartha Trading Company. The great Agartha is an unaligned Guild that says they do business with all factions for the sake of commerce. But what is generally known is that the Celestial Wind Lotus is the lover of the Dark Queen Hecate. 
So not only are the ports protected by their own guards, but also by the decree of the Mistress of the Maelstrom herself. 
For the sake of lowering costs, these little port towns are manufactured modularly. And heroes will find that every little town has a different selection of shops, characters, and places to visit while they decide the next move. 
But like all Gemini favored locales, every town has a Cloudport and a Tavern. And a selection of other interesting locales. They are lively bustling places full of life and color. And the wares of a thousand islands can be seen traded in these freebooter paradises. Ships from every Arcana and people from all the realms can be found mingling peacefully here. 
The style of the architecture reflects the princess’s origins. And their name the esteem the corsairs hold the princess. Celestial coves they are called. Celestial style architecture from the imperial city of Xiang’lu feature heavily in its designs. But they are far from the austere and serene places in the imperial city. For the boisterous celebration of victorious pirates and lamentations of those held in defeat fill the night air. 
A hero will find incredible items and powerful Skyship upgrades at any Celestial cove they may come across. And sometimes, some very intriguing quests to add to an ambitious hero’s adventure journal.

        Rockets
        
        (Reference image - click link for more)
        The preferred weapons platform of the Gemini Alliance, rockets provide deadly area destruction and area of effect saturation against hardened targets. 
        Lacking in precision or remote guidance, these weapons are best used en mass fire from multiple launch rocket systems. Vast numbers of rockets all exploding with formidable power can cripple entire fleets of ships in short order. 
        Preferred by fast moving raiders who come in quick and unload huge amounts of damage before landing the coup de grace, rockets provide massive firepower in a short time period. However reload times for rocket systems are much longer than the other ship weapon types
        
        
        Other Gemini Peoples
        Edward Teech - Chaos Captain
        
        The strongest of pirates command their own skyships, and each has their own style. However, a hero can be assured that any pirate captain carries an incredible array of weapons and powerful artifacts from across the cloudsea.
        Among the most fearsome skyfaring legends, one that stands above the rest, is the Dreaded Blackbeard - Edward Teech.
        The dread pirate commander actually fought his way out of the Abyss and climbed the ranks of the Gemini Alliance to become one of the most Legendary Privateers of the Cloudseas. Currently serving in the high admiralty, his is one of the few Pirate lords that does not make their home on the Queensreich. 
        Teech can be found sailing the endless skies in his Argo Heavy Cruiser, the Red Diamond. His ship is armed with a deadly array of captured ivory tower weaponry and the most elite Gemini firepower. His ship alone is enough to devastate entire fleets, but he never sails alone. At least a few trusty Gorgon gunships and several wings of skyshark marauders are always following his trail.
        Captain Teech favors wielding a pair of heavy scimitars along with a pair of custom blitzhammers for close personal encounters. 
        Teech and his fleet are always ready to come at the call of the Dark Queen, his lover, Hectate. 
        
        
        Witch Hunters
        
        (Reference image - click link for more)
        Gemini Fleet mage killers, Witch Hunters are specialized assassins trained and honed for a single purpose - track down and eradicate magic users. 
        Trained in the arts of stealth and tracking, Witch Hunters are the Gemini Fleet’s not so secret weapon against their bitter rivals in the Ivory Tower. With the Tower’s near monopoly on spellcraft and technomancy, the geezers in the tower have brought nearly all of Midgard to its knees. 
        And the Ivory Tower is far from a benevolent or just ruler. Tower taxes are so high, people starve in the streets. Their use of robotic soldiers does little to gain the trust of the people. 
        When nearly any infraction can be answered by bullets from the gun of a Lawgiver, fear of the tower’s arbitrary and nonsensical edicts rules over the lives of many in Midgard. Those whose families and livelihoods have been lost to Tower Thieves with badges have nowhere else to turn. Hmmm except of course to the Dark Queen and the Gemini Alliance. 
        A select few who survive the years of wandering the outlands fighting off countless attacks from mechanoids and demons alike, a select few are given the blessing of Hecate and allowed to enter the mysterious Maelstrom temples to train with the union of assassins.
        In the temples the chosen warriors bodies and minds, already battle hardened, become even stronger, clearer. Dark enchantments are cast upon the hunter and their weapons allowing them to perfect their stealth and concealment skills. 
        Upon completion of their training, each Witch Hunter is given a wondrous treasure. The latest rapid fire Tesla repeaters are the badge of office for-these deadly killers. Unlike hand cannons, crossbows have limited range and stopping power - unless of course you are a hunter and carry poisons and explosive warheads. The repeater has great rate of Fire and fires nearly silently allowing a Witch Hunter to sneak up on a wizard and riddle them with poisoned or exploding crossbow bolts. 
        This combined with their preternatural speed and agility make them incredible fighters. A witch hunter is the type to pick a fight with a dozen men for no reason, and kill them without a second thought. 
        To those who wear the symbols of the Tower, a Hunter has no mercy. Any who dare cross a Witch Hunter should count themselves lucky if they are the only one to die that day

In service to this strategy, Gemini Raiders often hide smaller ships like the Gorgon in nearby cloud walls and then strike their targets from an unseen angle while the enemy is preoccupied with the large cruiser that the small escorts are defending.
        These small and fast ships are equipped with point defense cannons and rocket launchers. They excel at harassing slow ships and are perfect for defense against the strike craft of other factions. Gemini task forces often employ several cruisers with dozens of these small gunships ready to swarm out and destroy those that cross into their sights.

        Order of Leo – Short Description
        Order of Leo NPC reference images 
        The Order of Leo is an army of peacekeepers based out of the High Heavens. Tasked with maintaining peace and order across the high heavens and Midgard, the knights of the Order can be found in nearly every city and port town in Midgard and Heaven. Their commanderies often are short handed due to the waning influence of the Order and can often be seen placing bounty notices and hiring mercenaries to assist them in their holy task of maintaining the supremacy of the light.
        Governed by the council of Knights General and The Archangels,  the knightly orders and Angelic hosts guard the gates of Olympus and patrol the Astral seas. They are the militant arm of the loose alliance of Archangels and knightly orders that control Heaven. Their charge is to guard heaven against attack and to protect the veil. The veil is a region in heaven where souls, gods, angels, and demons can cross over from the Astral Realms into the Mortal Universe. In ancient times, the gods used the veil to control all life in the mortal universe. It falls upon the Order of Leo to prevent that from occurring again. They are currently closely allied with the Greater Power Shiva who serves as the Celestial Emperor the defacto leader of Heaven. Shiva is an ancient god of light, and one of the few gods still allowed into Olympus. The Order of Leo aligns itself with the Archetype of Light. 
        
        History of the Order of Leo 
        The order of Leo are the guardians of the Light. While the sign of Leo has been in common use for over ten thousand years, the actual Order of Leo did not come into existence until around a five hundred years ago. The Order was formed during the period known across the realms as the great schism, the Lords of light fought a terrible war over doctrine and the right to rule. Scholars at the Great University have often posited that despite the outward differences between light and darkness, the rules of those arcana share many traits in common. Among which is a tendency towards monomania. For some reason, the gods of light and darkness do not share power. Every one of them seemingly believes they are destined to be the absolute overlords of the universe. And this belief often leads to tragedy. 
        A little over a thousand years ago, the most powerful of the Gods of light began to disagree over how to best maintain the faith of their followers and which laws should be passed onto mortals to best ensure their fealty to the light. And so they began sending heroes and prophets into the mortal realms to start great religions designed to steer the belief of the people in those worlds towards the preferred archetype of the God who was doing the meddling. Soon enough, the powers began sending their heros to worlds already being governed by other gods. And the followers of those religions took a note from the pages of their masters and began fighting amongst themselves. 
        Great and terrible wars and crusades began springing up on countless mortal worlds as well as across the Astral Realms. And when the mortals inevitably died in those wars, their souls brought their troubles with them into the afterlife. First, the pantheistic powers were defeated one by one as the followers of the monotheistic powers swelled the populations of the realms of light. The souls of those religious mortals banded together to form armies to continue the crusades that killed them in the mortal world. As could be easily predicted, chaos ran rampant. The thin veneer of alliance the Lords of light used to maintain cracked and fell off as the Gods began warring openly and directly with each other. 
        With the greater powers of light busy fighting each other over doctrine and dogma, none were left tending to the affairs of the souls that were once under their protection. Pirates, demons, and other unsavory types became commonplace and there was no safety to be had in the high heavens. For a time in Heaven it seemed there was to be no salvation, many believing the universe had turned topsy turvy. What they needed were heroes, but all the heroes were too busy fighting each other at the beck and call of their masters. 
        In true selfish form, the remaining Greater Powers of light cared nothing for any soul who was not sworn to their service. But the war had an unintended side effect which the Greater Powers of light did care about. Across many of the worlds upon which crusades has sprung up, humans began forming orders of hereditary warriors or Knights. For the most part, these orders of knights had single minded dedication to their own honor. And as happens during great wars, many of these knights died and their souls passed through the veil to reform in the Astral Realms. 
        At first the souls of those who worshiped honor over any deity were small in number, though still they banded together to try and stem the tide of darkness and chaos infiltrating the Heavens whilst the gods of Light continued their squabbles. As they began to beat back the darkness, more and more souls rallied to their cause, soon a singular entity formed around this noble cause. And thus the Order of Leo was brought into being. An organization dedicated to the defense of the good and free souls of the Astral realm, they bring the Law of Light to the varied corners of the Astral Seas. 
        
        The Lords General of the Order of LEO: 
        The Lords General command the knightly forces of the great Order of Light. It remains the responsibility of the order to ensure mortals do not fall under the tyranny of the Gods of Darkness, Chaos, or Light. In order to ensure the Pax Astralis Order navies are levied and patrol the skies as a sort of cosmic do Gooders. The Lord Generals command these great navies in service to the light. 
        In recent centuries the Tower has begun building their own ships, which has significantly decreased funding to the Order. The player enters a faction of faded glory dreaming of the good old days of the past. As of late, alliances made between the Lords General and deities like Shiva have the rank and file of the Order concerned, but none can question the benefits of ships and materials the alliances have brought with them. 
        The Leo patrols consist mainly of fast moving corvettes and frigates which soar through the Astral seas using sails and a magical booster system tower scientists have yet to be able to replicate using their arcane technomancy. The standard Leo tactic is to close the distance with their incredible sustained cruise velocity, and then grapple enemy ships and board them with their elite squads. Leo ships deploy squads balanced of a mage priest and fighters. Their practiced and precise teamwork overwhelms most pirate and demonic ships in the clouds. 
        While Tower mages scoff at their use, Leo ships still use basic ballistae. Their benefit is that they do not require ammunition storage, which offsets their much lower range. This allows the patrol ships to travel much greater distances with greater stores of food and logistical supplies. And also adds space for more troops.

        Leo ships have the lowest combat acceleration, but the highest cruise velocity.
        They use a divine magic booster system. 
        This booster system provides less thrust than rockets, however can be left on during long duration cruise without needing fuel.
        This allows Leo ships to catch up to and grapple with enemy ships in the long chase.
        At which point the Leo tactic is to tank incoming fire with their shields, and lock onto enemies with grappling Ballistae, and pull clues to unload order Shock Troops onto the enemy ships.
        Order of Leo Weapons usually are not enough to take down enemy ships, but their soldiers are individually stronger than the other factions. So they rely on Sky Marine style assaults.
        Leo Ships also boast energy shielding. Powered by priests of the illumination, prayers and rituals in the shield chapel generate a nearly impenetrable bubble of force that encompasses the entire ship.

        text: `Current Events - Leo
        The Order of Leo is unique in that it does not possess a single Greater Power as its absolute ruler. Instead there is a council of Knights and Angels that administers the daily functioning of the mighty organization. In current times however, it seems their dedication to democracy has waned. With incurring losses to Chaos and Darkness on almost every front, the Order of Leo have recruited Shiva to their cause. Shiva is an Elder God and is known to be mercurious in temperament. A vain and narcissistic being like all the Gods of light, his constant demands to be worshipped and obeyed without question have started cracks and schisms in the ranks of the Leo Knights. But for the time being, the Order cannot afford to part ways with Shiva. For it is only by the might of Shiva’s great fleets the heavens kept safe. 
        And this is where the player enters. Into a world where goodness is but a passing memory and light seems more like evil than the darkness. The Order has been losing ground on all sides for centuries, and only with the greatest of luck and strongest determination can the cosmos be set back to what it should be. As a Power of the light, it falls to the player to fight back the darkness and bring back the light of the Greater Powers.
        
        Celestial Emperor - Shiva 
        The Celestial Emperor is largely a ceremonial position and possesses no inherent powers or responsibilities, but is regarded by all as the de facto ruler of Heaven. 
        The current Celestial Emperor is the Greater Power Shiva. However his term is set to expire in ten years time, which comes as a relief to many. Shiva has begun to act strangely of late enacting many policies that confuse and enrage the citizens of the upper plane. (Shiva is actually Mars, as Mars and Zeus secretly killed Shiva and installed Mars in his place when Zeus took over the Abyss - with the ultimate goal being Zeus attacking heaven from below while Mars/Shiva attacks heaven from within)
        
        Example Leo Quest - Captains Log
        On this fourteenth day of the 516th cycle of Order a curious sight was shown to me upon my scrying mirror. Two ships engaged in furious battle. On one side (insert arcana here) Chaos, and on the other (insert arcana here) Order. While our duty is to maintain the peace, out here in the fringes of the great sea, such considerations were a luxury. On the one hand (insert tier one plot grievance) the Gemini Pirates were a scourge on the seas. On the other, Ivory Tower cloudwhaling ships outside of whaling lanes is clearly poaching... 
        So I stood upon the precipice, should I Do nothing (+25 Chaos, +25 Order): ...this was none of my affair. Both sides were breaking the law, but I made a note to keep an eye out for those ships in the future. 
        Intervene and take whalers prisoner. (+25 Leo, +25 Chaos): cloudwhales are getting ever scarcer. With the tower’s relentless thirst for floatstones they’d kill all the whales if given half a chance. We will be discharging these criminals to the Leo precinct in the next town we fly to. 
        Intervene Destroy poachers (+50 Chaos): cloudwhales are getting ever scarcer. With the tower’s relentless thirst for floatstones they’d kill all the whales if given half a chance. I decided it would be best to eliminate this threat while had the chance 
        Intervene Destroy Pirates (+50 Order): Piracy is a scourge to the shipping lanes. As Leo Officers it is our duty to rid the skies of pirates. I decided it would be best to eliminate this threat while had the chance

        (Reference image)
        The high heavens are a realm of eternal light and beauty. Their buildings and fortifications are most often constructed of gleaming marble and precious metals which are common in the heavenly realms. 
        Floatstone interacts strongly with heavy metals and as such, islands rich in gold and silver tend to have a higher lift capacity and float to the upper strata.
        The inhabitants of heaven use these materials to their advantage and build massive castles and cities of incredible beauty and fantastic wonder.
        Many travelers come to the heavens to just stare in awe at the amazing landscapes and unforgettable sights.
        Visitors to the heavens often remark at the peace and harmony experienced by the inhabitants as they go through their everyday lives. From the mighty celestial waterfalls at the edge of Mount Olympus to the Aurora Fountains in the Heart of Asgard, travelers are sure to find sights to lift the senses and inspire awe in their viewers.
        
        The major decisions affecting the upper plane are made in the twin Capitals of Olympus and Asgard. These mighty cities were once ruled by pantheons of deities, but in recent times after the exile and banishment of most of the greater powers to the lower planes, administration of the heavens is handled by the great Celestial Bureaucracy. 
        At the top of the Celestial Bureaucracy is the Judicia Majora. This vast faceless organization permeates every aspect of the lives of the inhabitants of heaven. Judging merit and worth and dispensing justice to the peoples of heaven. The celestial bureaucracy is divided into an endless array of lesser organizations known as administrata. Each of which possesses its own internal organizational structure. 
        The Judicia Majora consists of representatives from the Order of Leo, the Legio Asura, and Imperial appointees of Asgard, Li’Shang, and Olympus. Every thousand years, the Judicia elects a leader from the council to represent the face of heaven itself and elevates them to the status of Celestial Emperor. 
        The Celestial Emperor is largely a ceremonial position and possesses no inherent powers or responsibilities, but is regarded by all as the de facto ruler of Heaven. The current Celestial Emperor is the Greater Power Shiva. However his term is set to expire in ten years time, which comes as a relief to many as he ha begun to act strangely of late and has enacted many policies that confuse and enrage many of the citizens of the upper plane.

        Olympus 
        Set atop the gleaming marble slopes of the Eternal mountain,the city of Olympus shines resplendent as the height of creation and the pinnacle of aspiration for both gods and men.
        
        Built of the marble hewn from the mountain itself, the streets and buildings of the ancient city glitter in the light of the divine illumination. For all are embedded with precious gold and silver. Indeed the city of Olympus has more gold in one street than exists in all of Midgard.
        
        But it is not the material that causes visitors to the eternal city to stare in awe. Breathtaking and elegant designs adorn every structure and rampart. Every tower and turret from the port of Poseidon on the lower edge of the mountain, where ships can be seen docking and undocking at all times, to the ancient Parthenon of the Gods on the very peak, the sign of treasured craftsmanship lies everywhere.
        
        And covering the walls of many buildings lie the Phoenix banners of the Legio Asura and the Lion Banners of the Order of Leo. Demonstrating the combined might of heaven 
        
        Across the length and breadth of the city lie temples and shops and houses. The hustle and bustle of everyday life fills the air with a cheerful melody. And flying above the throngs below are angels of the Legio Asura, ensuring the peace of the emperor remains on those streets below.
        
        And beside the ancient Parthenon lies the immense fortress headquarters of the Order of Leo, the Temple of Apollo. Here the great Lords General of the Venerable and mighty Order plan and strategize to counter the movements of darkness across the realms.
        
        And in the Parthenon itself lies the imperial throne. Where the eternal deity Shiva watches over the realms as the Celestial Emperor.
        
        However monuments alone do not define a city, and the lifestyle of such a densely populated city has led to many amazing improvements. Any area not taken up by a residence or shop has been converted into hanging terrace gardens. And the eternal light of the illumination allows these food bearing plants to grow all year round. Starvation and want do not exist in Olympus.
        
        However this is not without cost. The Gates of Olympus must always be closely watched, lest those who are unworthy may seek to lay claim to the bounties of Olympus. And doing this are a full legion of the Asura and the ancient phoenix god Bahamut himself.

        Legio Asura 
        While the Order of Leo and their questing knights are the most well known soldiers of the High Heavens, they do not form the greater part of the defenders of the gates of Olympus. 
        This great task and honor is mainly performed by the mighty forces of the Legio Asura. These angelic warriors stand as the bulwark of the defense of heaven against invasion by the demonic hordes of the Abyss. By tradition the Legions consist of the mightiest of Battle Angels drawn from the races of the Seraphim and Valkyrii. 
        
        Legio Asura Organization:
        There are three greater Legions, Each commanded by a Valkyrie or Seraph called an Archangel. 
        One Archangel is selected every hundred years to serve on the council of Generals in the Order of Leo. 
        Each of the Legions consist of one thousand soldiers. Which are then divided into ten cohorts of a hundred. 
        Each Cohort is commanded by an Archon who is usually the most powerful Angel, Mortal Hero, or Valkyrie in their ranks. 
        While legend says that angels were once formed from the very essence of light in the beginnings of time, in current days Seraphim and Valkyries are drawn from the worthiest of mortal applicants and transformed into beings of light in a secret ceremony held by the Archangels during the festival of light. 
        
        Seraphim 
        Seraphim are the most powerful of the Angelic races. Possessing a physical form reminiscent of a beautiful human man, they are possessed of great strength and immense magical power. Blessed by the gods of light and formed from the divine power of the Astral Realms themselves, Seraphim are essentially immortal and individually can easily defeat most demons and lesser entities. They can be most easily recognized by the large glowing wings that extend from their backs. These wings also grant Seraph the ability of individual Flight. Their inherent magical affinity makes them formidable spellcasters and healers, which is the role they often fill while serving in the Legions. 
        
        Valkyrii
        
        (Reference image - click link for more)
        Valkyries are the reconstitution of the souls of the greatest warriors and heroes that enter the High Heavens. Normally a Valkyrie takes the form of a beautiful Human woman clad in luminescent Platemail Armor. Each is trained for centuries in the arts of combat and warfare and are generally considered to be the finest individual fighters in all the Astral Realms. Valkyrie possess immense physical strength and an inborn regenerative capacity. Wounds that would kill or cripple any other being can be shrugged off by these mighty warriors in a matter of moments. 
        Squads of Valkyrii are often used as heavy shock Tripp’s who serve in the frontlines of the Angelic Hosts. While they do not have wings and cannot fly themselves, they keep in service stables of Pegasi, magical winged horses, which the Cavalry Cohorts use for scouting and tactical assaults against the most formidable enemy defenses.

        Ivory Tower – Short Description
        Ivory Tower NPC reference photos 
        
        (Reference image)
        The Ivory Tower is the most technomagically advanced Arcana. The elite citizens of the tower are dedicated to the study of science and magic. Their society prizes knowledge above all things. Inventors and technomagi rule over all elements of their civilization
        Collegia Scholarium: 
        Based out of the Ivory Tower, The Collegia Scholarium consists of several Schools. Each school is governed by an Archmagus. The three most powerful schools in the Collegium are the schools of Motion, Power, and Time. 
        The School of Motion is headed by Isaac Newton. They construct the clockwork soldiers of the ivory tower armies and are responsible for the maintenance of its ships and cities. 
        The School of Power is governed by the Archmagus Nikola Tesla. They build and create the various technomagical devices that ensure the superiority of Vollegium forces across the Astral Realms. From weapons to communication devices, the inventions of the great Archmagus have secured the place of the school of power in the Ministorum. 
        The youngest and smallest of the three great schools is the School of Time. Administered by the brilliant Archmagus Albert Einstein, they maintain the records and calculate the relative positions and temporamagical status of the Collegium activities. Without the calculations of the navigation devices created by the school of time, accurate travel in the Astral Realms would be highly improbable. 
        The Ministorum Scholaris is what the ruling body of the Ivory Tower is called. The three greatest scholars and mages of the Collegium serve on the Ministorum. The leader of the triumvirate holds the title Thor (Currently Isaac Newton). The Collegia Scholarium maintains order across all of Midgard. It’s fleets and armies are considered to be insurmountable. And the technomagical ability of the Ivory Tower is unsurpassed by any others. 
        The Ivory Tower is generally a peaceful nation, seeking knowledge instead of war; however, While the Dark Lord Zeus sat upon the throne in heaven, all schools were pushed into assembling a great army to see the corrupt ruler fall. Finally came the fateful day when the Dragons of the Order were unleashed upon the heavens. 
        The combination of true draconic energy & clockwork monstrosities made the Dragons of the Order even more deadly that originally anticipated. Their Death rays alone breached the gates of Olympus. Once the gates had fallen, none in heaven could stand against the wave upon wave of Ivory Tower Mechanoid soldiers. 
        The mightiest of the gods fell that day. And Zeus was cast from his throne in Olympus to eke out an existence in the Abyss. 
        
        History of the Ivory Tower
        Amidst the chaos and darkness that threatens to engulf all the Astral Realms in everlasting night, there stands one beacon of hope. While even the mighty walls of heaven have become fractured and frayed, the Arcana of Order remains seemingly untouched. 
        Maintaining a policy of strict neutrality the scholars of the Ivory Tower have deftly sidestepped every offer of alliance from the Order of Leo and the strength of its legendary clockwork army have kept marauding pirates and demon armies at bay. 
        Across the entirety of the Astral Realms, none can compare to the technomagical prowess of the great schools of the Collegia Scholarium. Every year millions of applicants make the pilgrimage to the great university in the hopes of being chosen to become one if the students and perhaps one a scholar or magus of the Tower. Through the knowledge and research attained at the great university, the Order of Midgard is sustained. 
        This is not to say that the Great University is some utopia. In fact being ruled by nothing but mages and scholars has led to some troubling trends. Social services are nearly nonexistent and every Archmagus has their own agenda. This leads to constant intrigue within the tower itself. And to add to the list of ever growing troubles, the great Sorcerer King Thor has not been seen for many years. 
        
        Tower Leader: King Thor
        Before there ever was an Ivory Tower, the Greater Power Thor was in charge of Midgaurd. The title of Thor was once held by a Nordic demigod until recent years when a stranger from the mortal realms somehow managed to penetrate the veil between worlds without using magic. During an epic struggle against the Gemini Queen Hecate, the old Thor was mortally wounded and passed his mantle to the newcomer who had circumnavigated the veil. 
        In the years since the mortal soul took the mantle of Thor, the Arcana of Order has changed drastically. Coming from a band of maritime raiders in the mortal realm aligned with the symbol of Aquarius, the new Thor introduced an arcane knowledge he called “science”. Utilizing this strange knowledge the great university was founded. Scholars and mages from across the Astral Realms flocked to the university turning what was once the least of the four great arcana into its most powerful force. Using a combination of sorcery and science, the great Ivory Tower was constructed at the heart of the University. While the tower stands neutral in the current wars between the Order of Leo and House Aries and the Gemini Pirates, the scholars of the Tower knew they must form a defense in case of possible attack and constructed the clockwork army, mechanical soldiers built to weather the storm of the war between the Greater Powers.
        
        
        
        
        
        Current Events – Life at the Tower
        King Thor remains cloistered away in his laboratories searching for some great secret only he seems to know about. Strange, capricious, and often contradictory commands are issued from the Tower from time to time. None seem to be able to make any sense of it. A great many students and professors are beginning to believe that the Tower has traded order for madness. Which is terrible news for any who dwell alongside the Great University, as the Ivory Tower seems bereft of any real order anymore. For it is clear to see, for anyone who has eyes at least, that the circumstances outside the university itself cannot be allowed to continue on their current course. With all the other Arcana at war with one another, even the Tower will eventually fall to the chaos if the other Arcana are left unchallenged.
        Despite these problems, the Ivory Tower has an advantage no others can match. The mighty Akashic records held in the Great University contain a bewildering array of knowledge and Magic’s available only to the scholars of the Tower. Using the records, a hefty dose of sorcery, and the secrets of science and technology brought by the new Thor from the mortal planes, the tower mages have created a massive army of mechanical men and Dragons and now operate merchant fleets on par with Shiva and the Gemini Pirates. Rumors of a massive floating fortress turtle under construction in the university shipyards rumbles through the Astral Realm. It is believed such a powerful battlestation may stop any who would dare challenge order in the Astral realms. 
        Others believe it to be a colossal waste of resources, since who in their right mind would attack the University? The city is choked with refugees and starving homeless souls. An expensive weapon solves none of the pressing issues plaguing the administrators of the last free city. 
        The greatest fear of all, however, might be the powerful battlestation is a necessity. 
        Tales spread of a huge army massing on the borders of the darklands. Whispers that the Fallen One is preparing to see the tower crumble before him. And perhaps there is truth to these rumors. It would explain why they are building the most powerful ship ever seen in the Astral. But there are doubts the project can even be completed. 
        The archmagi keep sending scouting parties searching for magical materials and mystical secrets to get the damn thing to fly. Supplies of floatstone have become ever more rare as the armies of darkness and the pirate fleets conquer every resource rich island. Even convoy fleets with their galleons and holds full of Alsatian Float Crystals are falling prey to adventurous pirate Lords slowly progress. If the telecrystals and social scrying mirrors are to be believed, a research convoy was recently attacked by the Gemini Goblin Captain Thrakkamor, lost with it a cache of secret technologies. 
        The Pirates seem to have lost any sense of fear or respect they once had for the agents of Order. Their attacks have become increasingly coordinated as of late, almost as though the Arcana of chaos has been infused with some terrible order. 
        
        This is where the player comes in. As a fledgling power, it does not die to simply sit in dusty classrooms and dank libraries while the universe crumbles all around. Now is the time for action, and maybe now something can be done so that the histories will write that we did not just stand idly by, but instead returned to Astral Realms to a state of clockwork precision on their way to becoming one of the Greater Powers.

        text: `Ivory Tower Home Base: Midguard 
        Among the three great planes of Heaven, The Abyss, and Midgard; midgard is by far the largest. The great floatplane of Midgard stretches endlessly in all directions. The number of islands and even continent sized land masses held within its confines are beyond knowing. 
        The realm of Midgard consists of an innumerable collection of small floating islands and a few massive continent sized land masses. All adrift in the great Cloud seas, born aloft by the floatstone embedded in their very cores and through the rocks that form the structures of their existence. 
        And across it all, rule is claimed by the Collegia Scholarium. Using their Marshall’s, agents, and mechanized armies, the will of the Ivory Tower is known to all across Midgard. Or so the fools in the tower would have you believe. 
        Midgard is vast and as such, it is mostly ungovernable. To help compensate for this, the University sends out Lawgiver Mechanoids and field professors to spread the word of science. But there are too few traveling professors and too many problems to be fixed. 
        The corruption within the tower itself is becoming clearer and clearer to see for all who look. 
        Luckily, the Tower is not all there is to the Collegia. Three great schools currently dominate the politics of the entirety of the Scholarium. And each governs over one of the three capitals of Midgard. 
        Rumors circulating say the Tesla factory furnaces have been burning smelting ore and tempering the Porcelite every night to create massive numbers of Fenrir and other clockwork Troops. Details surrounding the night work and the reasons behind it have been shrouded in secrecy. Those in the know whisper about a coming power struggle, and the Archmagus Tesla may be preparing himself for an attempt to seize control of the Collegium. Tesla aims to displace the school of Motion and place the school of Power at the top of the collegiate the triumvirate. 
        While other rumors persist that the School of Time and the mysterious Archmagus Einstein have predicted an apocalyptic war and that the factories of the School of Power have responded to this warning and are preparing the defense of Midgard. 
        Either way, the hearts and support of Midgard lie with the Tower and all wish for its continued primacy across the realms. Or at least that’s what the propo posters always say.
        
        The Ivory Tower:
        In the center of Midgard floats the bastion of order and capital of the Collegia Scholarium, the Ivory Tower. And at the apex of the Tower is set the eternal timeglass. Through precise calculation of orbits and motion, the timeglass sends out a stabilizing field that keeps the great floating continents and islands of Midgard from crashing into each other. 
        The Tower is a 50 story tall structure made of a white stone. It possesses articulated segments and flourishes built of brass and bronze colored clockwork gears.  The purpose of the tower is as the headquarters of The Great University and also houses the representatives of the Arcana of Order on the Astral Realms. As the primary school of magic and the greatest repository of knowledge in the Astral Realms, it possesses magical defensive structures and is guarded by the legendary clockwork army. Chief amongst the tools that maintain the great order of the Scholarium are the weapons of the Ivory Tower. 
        The oldest and most respected of the three great schools, the School of Motion makes its home in the tower. The School of Motions Archmagus, the mighty Newton, is the greatest of the three archmagni and reigns supreme. 
        
        The Foundry: 
        
        (Reference image - click link for more)
        Great factories and belching refineries fill the sky in this vast assemblage of floating islands connected by metal ramparts and chains. The factories and refineries of The Foundry manufacture the majority of technological goods used throughout Midgard. 
        From armies of clockwork regiments and mighty shipyards, all the way to consumer goods like Tesla beacons and skyfish nets, the Foundry is where its all made. The Foundry also adds its flavor of governance to the realms by building the Lawgiver mechanoids that enforce the will of the Scholarium across Midgard. 
        This gargantuan factory is surrounded by a city of the workers and technicians coming and going around the clock. The Foundry city has not one, but three great city gates, each used by fleets carrying goods and raw material to a from the great factories. 
        The Foundry is governed by the school of Power, which is headed by the archmagus Tesla. The great magos is considered to be the next Thor, after Archmagus Newton finally gives up the seat.

        While the greatest of magi research and tinker in the tower and the artificers toil in the Foundry, the minds and future of Midgard are shaped through the efforts of the great University. This wondrous city is the center of modernity and learning throughout all the realms. The most gifted artisans and masters of every trade come to the city to teach and learn. In a city such as this, there is no greater currency than knowledge. 
        In the center of the great city state lies the Collegia, the seat of the great councils of learning and administrators of justice. Graduates from all of the lesser colleges compete for entrance into the Collegia. And from these graduates, any who wishes the title of professor is granted. 
        To be a professor offers great social benefit as well as the benefit of learning but does require the spreading of science to a dark and IGNORANT plane. Many places still have heathen cults worshipping foolish gods. 
        “Replace their madness with reason and their ignorance with science.” 
        This is the credo of the great Marshalls. The strongest and smartest of the field professors is chosen to become a Marshall. Paired with a devastating lawgiver mechanoid, they are sent out across the great cloud seas to bring the power of science to the natives. 
        Marshalls have nearly unlimited authority and in times of war, Marshall’s are usually the first ones placed in command of mechanical soldiers. 
        Needless to say, the number of poor midgardian families dreaming of their child becoming a professor or Marshall is never small keeping the university a large and bustling metropolis filled with color and sounds of many cultures bound together by the codes of science. 
        
        The Expressway & Federation of Lemuria:

        In the depths of larger Midgard land masses, extreme pressures and temperatures have ignited the floatstone and carved out great caverns lit only by the eldritch flickering glow of the floatstone that burns to this day. 
        In these caverns lies the great federation of Lemuria. This alliance consists of villages and cities hewn from the stone of the caverns themselves. And this great empire of the darkness beneath stretches between many land masses, connected by underdark portals and great darkened highways through which men and materiel flow like water through a river. 
        The greatest of these highways is the Cavern Expressway, often referred to as just “The Express”. This expressway is one of the largest and most ambitious projects of the Collegia Scholarium and connects the great cities and towns of the underdark with an endless track made of the finest spellsteel.
        Along these tracks run the great Centithread engines. These are mighty clockwork trains built by the finest artificers of the School of motion powered by mighty floatstone enhanced magnetic levitation motors. These wonders of Ivory Tower technomancy float above the Spellsteel tracks and traverse the vast darkened caverns and tunnels at prodigious speeds. Stations at every major underground city along with passages to the surface create a vast network that spans the whole of known Midgard. 
        Those who find themselves lost in the ancient tunnels and caverns need only walk in one direction long enough and will inevitably come across the tracks of the great expressway. And for those caught underground or unable to acquire a skyship, finding an expressway station is often the fastest and most expedient means of travel to any corner of the great plane of Midgard.

        Lawgiver Mechanoids
        These dual crossbow wielding robots are found throughout midgard always accompanied by a professor. The professor brings the knowledge of the Collegia Scholarium to the vast reaches of Midgard while the Lawgiver mechanoids protect the professor and deliver the Tower Law and edicts. 
        Smarter than the average combat robot, these all purpose machines are specifically designed to interact with humans and humanoid contact. In order to accomplish this new series Tesla Mk XXIV Tesla cogitators have been installed in their primary cogitating unit. Inscribed upon this enchanted clockwork and electrical device are the codes and edicts of the Ivory Tower. This creates one of a rare breed of thinking mechanoids. They possess sentience and a will of their own. This is why hard inscribing a purpose of guarding their professor is so necessary 
        To further blend in with the locals, Lawgiver mechanoids dress in clothing. The common style is a brown leather duster style trench coat over common gard of Ivory Tower citizenry and a western outlands style hat. Under the trench coat the Lawgiver carries two repeating handheld Teslacaster crossbows. 
        The duel wielded crossbows allow the robot to unleash a deadly hail of fire while their mechanoid armor and resilient construction shrug off incoming attacks. Coupled with their professor’s own deadly skills, the metal agents of the tower a formidable threat to any miscreants who dares break Tower Law.
        
        
        Clockwork Soldier
        
        Midgard is an endless expanse of landmasses, underground empires, and vast floating archipelagos. With an uncountable number of people and a sparse long territory, the Ivory Tower could never field an army large enough to defend it all. That was of course until the Archmagus created the great Foundry. From the monstrous factory city now comes numberless legions of clockwork Mechanoid soldiers. Made in dozens of variants and each imbued with enchanted armor and advanced tower weaponry, the Clockwork Regiments are a vast and insurmountable obstacle to any who would dare challenge the supremacy of the Tower Scholars.
        Tower Guardian
        
        The most dangerous and elite mechanoid soldier employed by the Ivory Tower, perhaps none are as feared as the Tower Guard. Equipped with plasma weapons and incredible strength, These massive humanoid clockwork monstrosities stands nearly 50 spans tall!!! Even one of these war titans is more than enough to swing the balance of power in the Ivory Tower’s favor.
        
        
        Thunderbird Assault Frigate 
        
        
        Fenris MK II “Desert Fox”:
        The venerable Fenris MKII Light Reconnaissance Scout was one of the first of the Ivory Tower’s Mighty Mechanoid Regiments. Built with the finest materials and the highest quality clockwork, this recon Mechanoid is able to reach incredible speeds while running and maintain operations deep in enemy territory for weeks without needing to be rewound.
        While not as deadly as the newer MkVII Fenris Assault Mechanoids, the old MkII’s still hold their own. 
        Without their scouting abilities, the clockwork regiments wound quickly lose the information advantage and that could spell doom.
        
        
        Fenris Mk IV:  Fenrir-Attack-Mecha
        
        The Fenris Class Heavy Attack Mecha is the primary frontline assault weapon of the Ivory Tower ground forces. This brutal clockwork beast was designed as a direct response to the effectiveness of the Ravager Demons of House Aries. Overengineered and expensive to build, each one of these mechanical monstrosities is the equal of three or more Ravager demons. 
        Assigned organizationally to the Stormwolf Battalions, units of Fenrir battle beasts can be found spread across Midgard; however, most are stationed close to the Planar gates leading to the Abyss. 
        Unlike standard clockwork soldiers, the clockwork mechanisms of the Fenrir are heavily reinforced and possess a number of redundant systems. This means damage that would be catastrophic to lesser clockwork troops can be shrugged off by a Fenrir and it can continue to fight. 
        The robust and redundant internal construction is coupled with layers of heavy Porcelite Ceramic Armor plates and enchanted steel armor. This renders it nearly impervious to non-magical damage and gives it an enormous mass which makes its charge attacks and melee attacks a devastating force. 
        A Fenrir has a number of powerful weapons and attack systems. Powerful claw attacks, a devastating charge and trample attack, a tactical bite with immense bite force able to penetrate the thickest armor, and finally an electrical overcharge attack which stuns every enemy surrounding them to a range of ten meters. The blast attack was actually an accidental development made when technomancer engineers were looking for a way to dissipate thermal and energy buildups created inside the war machines. What started as an accidental discharge of ungrounded energy was refined into a devastating close range support weapon. 
        In terms of squad placement, two Fenrir mecha are usually paired with two clockwork riflemen that provide long range support fire during combat along with a Tower mage that serves as their squad leader. This squadron structure creates a balanced fighting force able to contend with the most elite soldiers the other great houses. 
        
        Dragons of the Order
        
        Mantaslasher
        Originally manufactured to be heavy floatstone miners and Leo Guardians, these clockwork monstrosities soon went haywire for no known reason. 
        All anyone knows is that all the miners are dead and every single Mechanominer had turned into a MantaSlasher. 
        Their incredible strength and speed, coupled with deadly piercing claws meant to tear through solid bedrock, turned them from a construction tool into the scourge of the underdark.
        Totally out of control and immediately hostile to any that cross its path, these rogue machines are very dangerous and should be avoided at all costs...
        
        
        
        Rabbit Golems (Legend of Mechabunnicus)
        
        Many legends and tales exist of mighty and powerful weapons and monsters from days of yore. Most of these tales involve fearsome monstrosities and terrifying encounters. These are tales told to credulous children in the darkest of nights. Stories that engender the deepest fear and incredible horror, 
        But to the everlasting chagrin of the Ivory Tower, the perennial favorite of the young at heart across the realms is the tale of the savior of Solstice Eve. The tale titled - Heart of the Mechabunnicus. 
        It is said, in ages long past, Solstice Eve was always accompanied by the arrival of the mad Artificer Archimedes the Elder. For those young at heart with a spirit filled with kindness and generosity, the Elder would suddenly appear in his ship driven by the light of divine illumination and deliver a wondrous Clockwork gift. This is a legend that persists to this day. Even more tales abound of brave and foolish souls who venture out trying to find Archimedes workshop in the great Northern Plane. 
        But I digress. 
        As the tale goes, one Solstice Eve the Dark God Aries sat upon his throne of skulls contemplating how to bring misery and suffering to all the realms. And his latest plan was to breach the planar gates on midnight at the height of the Solstice celebrations. 
        However, little did he know that Archimedes himself had other plans for the wondrous holiday. For unbeknownst to all, he had found a kind soul in each of the realms who had but one fervent wish. Each of these souls wished for nothing greater than for all to enjoy peace and happiness on the Solstice. 
        To each of them the Mad artificer gifted a small clockwork rabbit. And with each rabbit he imbued a special mission. Each golem would guide their new caretaker to the great Abyssal gate. All to meet when the divine illumination waned entirely and the gate opened to the lower planes. 
        The three young golem masters embarked each upon their own perilous quest to reach the gates. (These tales being holiday favorites as well. And will be told another time). And upon reaching the gates they all met with the great artificer himself. At that moment the planar gate opened and out strode the monstrous form of the ancient titan Aries. He had gathered all his might in preparation for this great assault to bring ruin to all the realms. 
        In his great form, Aries believed none could stand against him. He had poured the strength of countless sacrifices souls to power a physical manifestation that could crush a Sky Kraken in one hand. He felt invincible, unassailable. 
        And as he stepped forth from the planar gate, his shadow stretched all the way to the Ivory Tower itself and his grasp reached the heavenly planar gate. All across the realms shuddered and hid in fear. For all now knew the time of doom was upon them. 
        But Aries overlooked one thing. Far beneath him stood the three young heroes, each holding in their hands a rabbit golem. Each of which was filled with the spirit of the Solstice from the hero’s adventure to reach the planar gate. And as each released their golem, the words of Archimedes called out. To all a merry Solstice, and to each a good night! And the golems suddenly used the power of the goodwill of the planar inhabitants to grow in size and strength. And began to battle the immense titan Aries. 
        But even the might of the creations of the mad artificer seemed unable to stem the advance of darkness. 
        Then the Solstice miracle occurred. Each of the three heroes gave their own soul to their golems and the three mighty mecha combined into a single monstrous mechanical reaver known as the Mechabunnicus. And in the greatest battle ever experienced in the realms. The Mechabunnicus slew the ancient titan and the Solstice was saved. And the planes knew peace for a thousand years until the god Mars took the seat of house Aries for himself. 
        Legends persist that the rabbit golems still exist somewhere. Maybe in the workshop if the mad artificer himself. But all the tales say, when the Solstice becomes darkest and the spirit of the Solstice wanes. The Mechabunnicus shall return to save the planes. 
        In commemoration of the tale of the Mechabunnicus, lesser artificers have recreated copies of the rabbit golems. And many a mage and adventurer has one of these lesser copies in the holds of their ships to do battle with would be miscreants. And families all across the realms can boast a rabbit golem or two as companions and guardians. ` ,

        text: `Midgard Weapons 
        The cloud forces of the Collegia Scholarium are amongst the most powerful and deadly in the realms. Ivory towers scholars and artificers have strived to create monsters of technomancy formidable enough to defeat any other house militaries. From regiments if clockwork soldiers and hard hitting magic forces, all the way to a unique and devastating navy, Ivory Tower combat forces are unequalled across the planes. 
        
        Teslacaster (crossbow)
        
        The highly coveted Teslacaster is a weapon prized and envied by fighters and soldiers in every corner of the Astral Realms. This enchanted clockwork device is capable of rapidly firing multiple types of enchanted crossbow bolts in rapid succession. Quiet and efficient, this weapon also has a large internal ammunition storage capacity, allowing players to equip an offhand item that is not a quiver. 
        Built by hand at the great Foundry and granted specialized inertia manipulation gears, this weapon only needs to be wound once and can fire a hundred bolts in rapid succession without needing to be rewound.
        This prized and valuable weapon is sought after across the realms for its beauty and devastating firepower. Constructed of the highest quality Ironwood and purest spring steel, these clockwork crossbows possess an internal kinetic acceleration reload mechanism powered by the latest in miniaturized Tesla converters.
        Rapid motion discharge capacitors spin rare and precious magnets inside the mechanisms at an extremely high rate of speed generating the massive torque necessary to draw and fire bolts from the coil quiver at a rapid rate.
        While not as directly destructive as a handcannon, these weapons produce much less noise when firing and are capable of firing many types of projectiles. From blunt, to poison, to even guided explosive bolts, the versatility a Teslacaster grants its wielder is simply unparalleled.
        
        Fireflower Missile System
        
        Among the latest advancements in technomantic engineering is the formidable Fireflower Missile System. Combining the newest advancements in tracking technology and Clockwork mechaneering from the schools of Motion and Power, along with advanced ballistic thought engines from the great archmagus Tesla himself, this beautiful and complex Tower design is capable of tracking multiple targets simultaneously and unleashing a barrage of destructive fire heretofore unimagined. 
        The Fireflower is able to launch dozens of rockets simultaneously at multiple targets, saturating an entire cloudfield with flame and fury. Multiple batteries of Fireflower arrayed together have been known to sink whole fleets in one barrage. Couple the incredible launch platform with advanced Krieglance Rockets built by the thousands in the great Foundry and you have a weapon system the tower magi can use to suppress any resistance or crush any would be invader. 
        Not only is the Fireflower the epitome of war machinery in terms of sheer destructive might, the Krieglance warheads on the rockets can switch between a number of different effects. From crew shattering shrapnel storms, to ship breaking kinetic energy munitions, all the way to time dilation field generators, the Fireflower’s Krieglance warheads can do it all. 
        This elite weapon is incredibly expensive to build and complex to maintain. Only the most elite cruisers of the ivory tower generally have access to such advanced technomancy.
        A hero who wishes to own one of these legendary weapon systems needs to be in the good graces of not one, but all three of the great schools of the Collegia. 
        
        Dominator Howitzer
        Famed and storied, the mighty Dominator Howitzers are a converted form of fortress based artillery, redesigned to function on a Skyship. Clad in the finest Porcelite plating and possessing a variable output barrel, these venerable weapons have served the tower fleet Arsenals for centuries. But don’t let their age fool you. 
        Inside a Howitzer are the finest of clockworks and stabilization systems. Bound in the variable output barrel are time dilation amplifiers which slow down time near the shell’s impact.
        Add to this incredible power, a field of fire and range that is unequalled amongst Skyship cannons. This weapon is the elite force in the cloud seas. The process to manufacture these behemoths of battle is drawn out and complex which leads to few being crafted in any given time. 
        These rare treasured weapons can turn the tide of battle in a moment’s notice. 
        
        
        Arc Cannons
        
        Designed by the Archmagus Tesla himself, these incredible weapons concert Astral Energy into electromagically charged ultra high voltage current which is then accelerated down a set of magnetic coils and released at an enemy. 
        Superheated plasma then Arcs between the emitters of the Arc guns and the target.
        These weapons possess high accuracy at close and medium range, however the capacitors take time to charge before firing and this limits the rate of fire due to high power requirements. Arc Cannons take up two Hardpoints, one for the gun and another for the Tesla converter which is linked to the Astral Sails to provide the raw Astral energy needed to convert into electromagical plasma.
        These weapons are rare and usually require friendly relations with the Ivory Tower to acquire

        text: `Ivory Tower Fleet Composition: 
        The strength of the Ivory Tower fleet lies in combat synchronicity and the variety of their ship attack roles. 
        Their main combat fleets consist of: 
        
        Thunderbird Assault Transports: 
        Far smaller than the frigates of other great houses and entirely lacking in long range weaponry, this close escort ship have immense short range acceleration and maneuverability. And unlike other ships it can land on top of the decks of the ships it boards and employ close range melee attacks alongside its boarding complement of squads of clockwork soldiers. Few ships can withstand a boarding action by this assault mecha and its mechanical warriors. 
        
        Clockwork Dragon Battlecruiser: 
        This corvette sized war machine shares many of the flight characteristics of its smaller thunderbird cousin. Incredible close range maneuverability and acceleration. And is able to bring down larger caliptak ships by landing in their decks and devastating them with mechanical melee attacks alongside devastating close range firepower. It also packs a company of clockwork soldiers that it can release onto the decks of any ship it engages in combat with. It can also wrap its body and tail around smaller ships and crush them into splinters using its unique articulated body structure. 
        
        Cannon Dreadnoughts: 
        
        This incredible dreadnought Class warship is the Ivory Tower’s central keystone for all of its assault and defense strategies. Carrying an army inside and powerful siege weapons all around, the Plasma Turtle is simply all the power of the Ivory Tower in a flying city sized fortress.
        These hulking battlestations move and turn slowly. And depend on their massive armor and guns to bring down lesser prey. Huge floatstone plasma mortars and twin linked Gatling Tesla cannons rain destruction upon enemies from massive distances. And an onboard short range teleporter engine built by the school of Time allows it to make sudden jumps to pull back to optimal firing ranges in the blink of an eye, or to suddenly close to boarding distance and flood enemy ships with battalions of mechanoid forces. 
        
        
        Mechatransports: 
        Possessing no weaponry and heavy armor, this ship do not excel at either speed or maneuverability. However these are the mainstay of Ivory Tower Naval Strategy. Each possesses twin Einstein class teleporters, allowing the ship to make two jumps in quick succession. They utilize this ability to close distance with enemy forces and then launch its complements of thunderbird Assault transports and occasionally a clockwork dragon. Then it teleports out of Weapons range to let its close range war mecha to annihilate the enemies.
